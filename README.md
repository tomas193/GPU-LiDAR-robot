# Centipide

## Overview
Centipede is a robot about path planning that was presented at the International Society for Optics and Photonics (SPIE). This project works with a Jetson Nano due to its GPU and a LiDAR sensor that measures the environment; then a path is calculated on each state and take action considering unkown obstacles. The implemented algorithm is a parallelized Iterative Deepening Approach that enhances path planning time compared to a CPU code execution. Also, a scientific paper was written to support this project and presented on the event.
