## Overview
PyStructAlgo offers a curated collection of Python implementations for various algorithms and data structures, compiled from academic coursework in the 'Structure of Algorithms' program. It's a resource for students and programming enthusiasts to explore algorithmic solutions and data structures in Python.

## Contents
This repository contains Python scripts covering:
- Sorting algorithms
- Search algorithms
- Data structures like trees, graphs, and linked lists
- And more

Each script is documented for ease of understanding and practical application.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/EdoMg2/PyStructAlgo.git
2. Navigate to the script of interest and run it using Python.
## Prerequisites
Python 3.x


## Acknowledgements
